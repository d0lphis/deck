Since the release of Kubernetes 1.9 and Windows Server version 1709, it's the great opportunity to let Windows networking be facilitated so Windows nodes can be added into IBM Cloud Private(ICP) Linux cluster.

This page serves as a guide for getting started joining a brand new Windows node to an existing ICP Linux cluster.

⚠Tip:
If you would like to deploy a cluster on Azure, the open source ACS-Engine tool makes this easy. A step by step [walkthrough](#https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/kubernetes/windows.md) is available.
